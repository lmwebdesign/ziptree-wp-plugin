Takes the Custom Post Type > Post > Attachments logical structure and creates similar file tree structure.

== Description ==

This plugin reads the Custom Post Types (CPT) > Post > Attachment logical structure and creates a 
similar file tree structure with a few  clicks, example:

* CTP Name > Post Name > Attached File(s)
* CTP Directory > Post Name Directory > Attached File(s)

Directories can be created at the CPT or Post level, example:

* User creates directory at CTP level, "CTP > all Posts > Attachment(s)" tree is created. 
* User creates directory at Post level, "CTP > selected Post > Attachment(s)" tree is created

Once created they can be zipped at the CTP or Post level. Once zipped they can be directly downloaded.

By default the script in charge of making the file tree structure has a run time limit of 120secs. 
If you have a Custom Post Type with a large number of Posts and/or many Attachments edit the lmwd-file-handler.php file
and increase `set_time_limit(120);`.
